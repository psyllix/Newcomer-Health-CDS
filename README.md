# Newcomer-Health-CDS
This artifact set includes two ordersets developed for the management of the newly arriving refugee patient in the United States of America. These orderset was developed based upon CDC guidelines for the management of the newly arrived refugee. Each order set contains al ist of orders,adocumentation template, and a set of recomended diagnoses. Orderset options are constrained based on the age and gender of the patient.

## Funding
Funding for this project provided by CDC Centers for Excellence in Refugee Health grant 5 NU50CK000459-02 (MN).
Support Module was funded by Centers for Excellence in Refugee Health grant 5 NU50CK000459-02 (MN) from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

# Usage
## Purpose
The purpose of this intervention is to encourage evidence-based, guideline-directed standardized care across institutions for newly arriving refugee patients while providing flexibility for local workflows. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) authors guidelines and maintains websites providing guidance

## Intended Population
These artifacts are intended for use with patients of all ages and genders who are initially arriving in the United States of America through a refugee resettlement agency program.
These artifacts are intended for use in the outpatient setting in a primary care office or public health
These artifacts have been installed at several institutions, we ask that organizations that install this work contact our team and provide feedback on the tools, the installation process, and recommendations for updates/changes.

## Development Decision Notes
A core group from the Center for International Health at the University of Minnesota, the Minnesota Department of Public Health, and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia was responsible for closely reviewing the CDC's guidelines for the U.S. domestic medical examination for newly arriving refugees, soliciting and collating user group input, reviewing feedback from state refugee health epidemiologists, and piloting the order sets and documentation templates. Development of the artifacts was informed by direct observations of workflow at 1 institution and indirect data collection on workflows at 20 organizations. Key steps within the workflow were identified by informaticists and a human-factor engineer as targets for CDS intervention. Using an iterative process the development team worked with clinicians to develop the CDS artifacts. The CDS artifacts were tested at the primary pilot institutions, further revised and disseminated to the secondary pilot institution.

# Supporting Evidence
The smart sets and documentation templates were developed drawing upon the cited references. A user group including health care providers from 20+ sites was involved in the assessment of guideline recommendations, prioritization of materials, identification of supplemental evidence, and the review of CDS during development.

The CDC maintains and updates the guidelines used to underpin this CDS. Updates to guidelines may occur and organizations implementing this CDS should develop a mechanism for monitoring for changes in the underlying evidence.

# Installation and Use
## Triggers
There are two separate artifacts: The previsit orderset and the domestic medical exam (DME) orderset. Previsit: Clinicians actively select the previsit orderset from the list of available ordersets. DME: Clinicians actively select the previsit orderset from the list of available ordersets. The orderset is suggested based on chief complaint.

## Inclusions
The CDS is intended for use in the care of refugee patients upon arrival in the United States. It is intended for the initial health care visit and not suggested for follow up care visits. Both the previsit and DME ordersets provide tailored CDS that is based on the age and gender of the patient.
## Exclusions
The previsit and DME ordersets are only accessible in the outpatient EHR context. There are no absolute exclusions to the initiation of these ordersets. However, activation would required a clinician to intentionally load the orderset.
## Interventions and Actions
Previsit: This orderset contains a group of preselected orders (based on the patient age and gender), optional orders, diagnoses, anda documentation template that can be used to capture information available to the clinician prior to the arrival of a refugee patient in clinic. 
DME: This orderset contains a group of preselected orders (based on the patient age and gender), optional orders and referrals, diagnoses, and a documentation template for the collection of information directly from the patient. Links to the underlying evidence sources, advise on how to use the DME smartset (for trainees), and support for administrative work are also included.
